# Google Maps API Setup Guide

## Current Issue
Your Google Maps API is showing "BillingNotEnabledMapError" which means billing is not enabled for your API key.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Enable Billing (Recommended for Production)
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Billing" in the left sidebar
4. Link a billing account to your project
5. Enable the following APIs:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API
   - Geocoding API (if needed)

### Option 2: Use Free Tier (Limited Usage)
- Google Maps API has a free tier with $200 monthly credit
- This is usually sufficient for development and small projects
- Enable billing but you won't be charged within the free tier

### Option 3: Use Alternative Map Services
If you prefer not to use Google Maps, consider:
- OpenStreetMap (free)
- Mapbox (free tier available)
- Leaflet.js (free)

## Current Fallback Solution
The dashboard now includes a fallback solution that:
- Shows coordinates when Google Maps is unavailable
- Provides direct links to Google Maps with coordinates
- Displays location data in a user-friendly format
- Allows manual location entry

## Testing the Current Setup
1. The map will show an error message when Google Maps API is not available
2. Click "Show Coordinates" to see saved locations
3. Use "Add Location Manually" to save coordinates
4. Click "Open in Maps" to view locations in Google Maps

## Next Steps
1. Enable billing in Google Cloud Console
2. Or implement an alternative map service
3. Test the GPS tracking functionality
4. Verify location saving and retrieval

## Security Note
- Your current API key is visible in the code
- Consider restricting the API key to your domain
- Set up proper API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console
